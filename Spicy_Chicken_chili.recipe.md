### Notes:

1. 0 points per 1.5 cups
1. You can use 99% lean ground chicken or turkey for this recipe. Ground beef or ground turkey sausage would also work but it will no longer be a zero point soup. You could also use chicken breasts. Just chop or shread it once it finishes cooking.
2. To deepen the flavors, sautee the peppers andd onions with the chicken before adding them to the slow cooker.
3. For a more tradional Weight Watchers chili, add your favorite beans to the mix. Kidney beans or any combination. And since beans ae zero points this doesn't change the points.
4. Think outside the box! This chili is really tasty as a soup but it can also be used in all types of recipies if use a little less broth. Consider scrambling it into eggs, add it as a topping for baked potato, make some sweet potato nachos or serving over spaghetti squash or with some melted cheese.
