We used packaged rotisserie from Costco (already off the bone).

* 32 fl oz chicken or vegetable broth
* 1/2 small bunch cilantro

* 1/2 medium yellow onion
* 1 medium zucchini squash
* 3/4 tsp chili powder
* 4 tsp extra virgin olive oil
* 1/4 tsp oregano, dried
* 1/4 tsp salt

### Directions

1. Place chicken on a cutting board and, using your hands, remove meat from the
   skin and bones. Separate the meat into shred-like pieces, place in a small
   bowl, and set aside.
1. Wash and dry the fresh produce.
1. Using a clean cutting board, peel, halve, and small dice onion; peel and
   mince garlic. Place in medium bowl.
1. Peel, trim, and slice carrot crosswise into thin rounds; add to the bowl with
   the onion and garlic.
1. Trim and slice celery crosswise into thin pieces; add to the bowl.
1. Preheat a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.
1. While the pan heats up, trim and halve zucchini lengthwise, then slice
   crosswise into thin half-moons; add to the bowl with the other veggies.
1. Once the pan is hot, add oil and swirl to coat the bottom. Add veggies and
   spices; cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, about
   3 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, cut lime into wedges and set aside.
1. Shave cilantro leaves off the stems; discard stems and mince the leaves. Set
   aside.
1. When the veggies have softened, add shredded chicken, broth, and pasta to the
   pan; cver and bring to a boil. Once the soup is boiling, reduce heat to
   mediuim and simmer, strring occasionally, until veggies and pasta are cooked
   through, about 8 minutes.
1. When the soup is done, add cilantro and stir to combine.
1. Divide soup between bowls and serve with time wedges on the side. Enjoy
